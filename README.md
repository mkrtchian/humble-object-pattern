# Humble Object Pattern

This project implements the main examples of humble object pattern described in [Unit Testing: Principles, Practices, and Patterns](https://www.manning.com/books/unit-testing) from Vladimir Khorikov, using TypeScript.

- The [Audit system example](src/auditSystem) from chapter 6 refactors a project from overcomplicated code (using the filesystem) to **functional architecture**.
- The [CRM example](src/crm) from chapter 7 refactors a project from overcomplicated code (using a database and a message bus) to **hexagonal architecture**.
